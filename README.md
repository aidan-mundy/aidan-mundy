### Hello, hello. How goes it? ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a:
- Software/Cloud/DevSecOps Engineer at Kythera Space Solutions
- Computer Science student at Northeastern University
- Software Mentor on FRC Team 246 Overclocked
- Developer on the Roblu Team

My public personal projects are attached to this account, and I am doing some work in the Roblu and FRC 246 Overclocked organizations.

For some repositories I have worked on in the past, [take a look at my forks organization](https://github.com/aidan-mundy-forks)! There is a lot of FRC code there, and some contributions to miscellaneous open source projects. 

At the moment, I am focusing my programming language learning on:
- Terraform
- Dart
- GitHub Actions

I'm a big supporter of FIRST and the FIRST Robotics Competition, it is an amazing opportunity for high school students, and everyone should know about it!
Here is my history in FIRST:
