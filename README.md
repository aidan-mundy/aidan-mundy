### Hello, hello. How goes it? ðŸ‘‹
I am currently writing code as a(n):
- CS student at Northeastern University
- Software Mentor on FRC Team 246 Lobstah Bots
- Developer on the Roblu Scouting Team

My public personal projects are attached to this account, and I am doing some work in the [Roblu](https://github.com/RobluScouting) and [FRC 246 Lobstah Bots](https://github.com/lobstahbots) organizations.

**For most of my open source contributions, and some other repositories I have worked on in the past, [take a look at my separate forks page](https://github.com/aidan-mundy-forks)!**

At the moment, I am focusing my programming language/technology learning on:
- Dart/Flutter
- Node/React/Bootstrap
- Go

I'm a big supporter of FIRST and the FIRST Robotics Competition, it is an amazing opportunity for high school students, and everyone should know about it!
