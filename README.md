### Hello, hello. How goes it?
I am currently a Software/Cloud/DevSecOps Engineer at Kythera Space Solutions and a Computer Science student at Northeastern University

At the moment, I am focusing my programming language learning on:
Terraform
Dart
GitHub Actions

I'm a big supporter of the FIRST Robotics Competition, it is an amazing opportunity for high school students, and everyone should know about it!
