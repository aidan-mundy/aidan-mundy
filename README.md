### Hello, hello. How goes it?
I am currently a Software/Cloud/DevSecOps Engineer at Kythera Space Solutions and a Computer Science student at Northeastern University

At the moment, I am focusing my programming language learning on:
Terraform
Dart
GitHub Actions

I'm a big supporter of the FIRST Robotics Competition, it is an amazing opportunity for high school students, and everyone should know about it!
FRC Team 87   Software Lead        2017-2018
FRC Team 5113 Software Contributor 2018-2020
FRC Team 246  Software Mentor      2020-Present

My current personal projects are attached to this account, and I am doing some work in the Roblu and FRC 246 Overclocked organizations.

For some repositories I have worked on in the past, [take a look at my forks organization](https://github.com/aidan-mundy-forks)! There is a lot of FRC code there, and some contributions to miscellaneous open source projects.
