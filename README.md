### Hello, hello. How goes it? ðŸ‘‹
I am currently writing code as a(n):
- CS Undergraduate Student at Northeastern University
  - Graduated April 2024. **Looking for full-time positions in SWE/DevOps/SRE/CloudEng**

My public personal projects are attached to this account.

**For most of my open source contributions, and some other repositories I have worked on in the past, [take a look at my separate forks page](https://github.com/aidan-mundy-forks)!**

At the moment, I am focusing my programming language/technology learning on:
- Kubernetes
- Dart/Flutter
- Go

I'm a big supporter of FIRST and the FIRST Robotics Competition, it is an amazing opportunity for high school students, and everyone should know about it!
